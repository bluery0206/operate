    <br/> You can enter the username you want and skip the email since the email feature requires some set-up to use.
    <br/> The password might not appear in the console even though you're typing. **_Trust me, you can't just see it but its there._**
    <br/> ![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93bb7c9-4b32-40bd-acf4-2c6eb7aff982)
    <br/> If your password might be too basic, this message might appear and you can just type `y` to not care about the password and proceed or `N` to change the password you entered.

    <br/> You can use the admin account we created to login.

**_Tip_**: _If the console appears to be stuck, try pressing any key from your keyboard to refresh or update. I don't know why it does that though._
